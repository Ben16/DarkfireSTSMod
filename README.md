# Darkfire Mod
A new character class mod for Slay the Spire. If you haven't played it, you can check it out [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/).

This mod is built using [Basemod](https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/wiki/Installation) and [Mod the Spire](https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire).

Note: You'll need to add a lib directory with BaseMod and ModTheSpire jars in it in order to build the mod. It'll be built to that directory.

# Details
I haven't made any real changes yet; when I do, I'll update this section.

# References
I used the [Basemod wiki](https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/wiki/Getting-Started-(For-Modders)
) for learning most of this. When I got stuck and couldn't find my answer there, I looked at Gremious's helpful [The Default mod](https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase).
