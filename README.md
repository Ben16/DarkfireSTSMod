# Darkfire Mod
A new character class mod for Slay the Spire. If you haven't played it, you can check it out [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/).

This mod is built using [Basemod](https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/wiki/Installation) and [Mod the Spire](https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire).

Note: You'll need to add a `lib` directory with BaseMod and ModTheSpire jars in it in order to build the mod. This mod will be built to that directory.

# Details
## Character
The Darkfire is a new character you can select. The selection icon and portrait are my art, as one can probably tell (think of it as placeholder art for an actual artist). The in-game art is just Ironclad, as one can also probably tell.

The Darkfire's cards revolve around exhaution and generating 'Flames' (0-cost, exhaust and ethereal cards that have small effects). As I add more powers and relics, hopefully the cards will have greater synergy with each other.

## Cards
* **Ash Spray** - deal 1 damage to each enemy 4 times.
* **Blaze** - gain 4 strength, lose 1 dexterity.
* **Blinding Flames** - inflict 1 Weak on all enemies and add 2 flames to hand.
* **Burning Form** - gain 1 flame card at the start of each turn.
* **Burning Shot** - deal 15 damage, exhaust a random card in hand.
* **Ember Shell** - gain 3 Block and inflict 1 Vulnerable.
* **Flare Storm** - deal 2 damage X times. Gain X flames.
* **Wheeling Flame** - deal 10 damage and draw 2 cards.

### Flames
* **Blue Flame** - gain 5 block.
* **Green Flame** - inflict 1 weak.
* **Purple Flame** - deal 6 damage.
* **Red Flame** - inflict 1 vulnerable.
* **Yellow Flame** - gain 1 energy.

## Powers
* **Burning** - gain a flame card at the start of each turn

I used the [Basemod wiki](https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/wiki/Getting-Started-(For-Modders)
) for learning most of this. When I got stuck and couldn't find my answer there, I looked at Gremious's helpful [The Default mod](https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase).
